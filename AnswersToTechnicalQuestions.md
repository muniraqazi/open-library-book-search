# Answers to Technical Questions

1. I spent about 25 hours on this assesment.
    a. If I had more time, my primary focus would be to work on error handling. For example returning an error message when the user searches for a result without an input. 
    b. Given even more time I would have focused on making the application more responsive on mobile and other devices. 

2. Arrow functions are my favourite feature of react. For me writing with arrow functions makes it faster to type and keep my code consice. An example where I have used an arrow function: 

`const handleChange = (event) => {
    setSearchedTitle(event.target.value)
}`

3. In order to track down performance issues I use browser dev-tools. My high performance PC can often hide performance issues that only users acessing my applications using less enhanced PCs, mobile phones and unstable wifi connections would encounter. To detect these bugs, I can use the dev-tools performance tab to slow down my broswer artificially and see how it would run on a slower device. 

4. I spent quite a while exploring the Open Library API in order to answer this question. Nearly every single page on Open Library is or has an API. There is an endless amount of data and an ever greater amount of things you can do with it. In conclusion, I do not see anything to improve, this is an amazing API.
